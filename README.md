# smartcommute
SmartCommute is a demo web application that simulates a real-time bus tracking and booking system. It is designed as a prototype for smarter public transportation in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, helping commuters find buses, check availability, and get live updates on seating and arrival times.
